# Patologi i Vest (PiV) - Data Management
This repository contains a demonstration of the data management architecture that we are using in Work Package 7 _Workflow Optimization_ of the regional healthcare project [Patologi i Vest (PiV) - a centre for applied digitization](https://helse-bergen.no/piv) in order to transform raw data produced by a laboratory information system into a format such that it can be used for _process mining_ and further processing. The transformation is developed using the academic prototype tool [CorrLang](http://www.corrlang.io). Thus, this repo also serves as a showcase and benchmark for CorrLang featyres. Due to confidentiality, we cannot share all of the metadata exeactly _as is_, but we show the significant part of it that is needed for understanding the idea.

The repository is currently under development, regular changes should therefore be anticipated.
